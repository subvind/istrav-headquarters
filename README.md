isTrav Extra is NOT free software; the code is however: open source. This gives everyone the chance to fully review and critique every detail. Unfortunately this exposes us to plagiarism. Modern search engines should be a deterrence to that and we hope it doesn't become an issue.

A great deal of effort, by me: Travis, has gone into the learning and development of this code. Please show your respect and I will return the same respect. Which means ... Do NOT remove copyrights.
