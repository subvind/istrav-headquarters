              <div>While our support may only be around 10 code repositories. We have chosen what works best, plays well with others, and covers all the bases. More software to be supported soon; requests are welcome.</div>

              <div>Syncronize multiple deployments of software together. So that when a user registers in one platform they are automatically registered across all the other platforms.

              <div>This may very well be our most important feature. Because any amount of data lose becomes critial when it comes to sensitive information. That can't happen.</div>
              <br />
              <div>Therefore, we have taken extra steps to make interacting with data as user friendly as possible. So we provide tools to get data in and out of each system by import and export. If data is kept behind a REST API we take advantage of that too.</div>

              <div>Getting software to run on a machine is half the battle. Further configuration, such as keeping products up to date in your online store or coding a script, is beyond the scope of our base services that we provide. With that being said, we do offer advanced support, however it is extra.</div>
              <br />
              <div>This mainly depends on what you are trying to achieve. Send us your requirements and well see what we can do. Source code modifications require a programmer (for software feature set changes) while tasks like keeping products up to date requires a developer (for business feature set changes). </div>
